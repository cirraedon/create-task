# Create Task

The [AP Computer Science Principles Exam](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/exam) has two portions: the multiple choice section and the "performance task".

For my performance task (referred to as the "Create Task" by my teacher, hence the name of the repo), I decided to write a (rather overcomplicated) calculator for matrices. 


Main.java contains executable code.

Operations.java contains a purely method contaning class that returns a new matrix based on the ones inputted.

Matrix.java contains the Matrix class.
